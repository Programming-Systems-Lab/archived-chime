/**
 * The csTreeBox class is a rectangle which contains a number of subrectangles,
 * each of which is recursively similar to its parent. In other words, every
 * tree item can contain a subtree itself. In very other words, the tree is
 * a graph, every vertex of which has one incoming and several outgoing edges.
 * The csTreeBox control can hold several trees at once (e.g. it can have
 * several "roots"). csTreeBox control ALWAYS contains just one selected
 * item at a time; multiple selection mode is not implemented (I don't see
 * why this may be useful anyway).
 *<p>
 * Every csTreeItem that is inserted into the tree is queried for its preferred
 * size (in particular its preffered height), and the next item is positioned
 * at the bottom of every previous item. Every csTreeItem asks in turn all his
 * child nodes (if the tree node is "open") or just returns its own height
 * without child nodes.
 *<p>
 * Example code how to create a tree:
 *<code>
 * csTreeBox *tree = new csTreeBox (app);
 * tree->SetRect (0, 0, 200, 400);
 * csTreeItem *item1, *item2, *item3;
 * item1 = new csTreeItem (tree, "My Computer");
 *   item2 = new csTreeItem (item1, "C:\\");
 *     item3 = new csTreeItem (item2, "Blindows");
 *     item3 = new csTreeItem (item2, "Suxx");
 *   item2 = new csTreeItem (item1, "D:\\");
 *     item3 = new csTreeItem (item2, "My Documents");
 *     item3 = new csTreeItem (item2, "My Toys");
 *     item3 = new csTreeItem (item2, "My Mom Told Me - Dont Run Windows");
 *   item2 = new csTreeItem (item1, "\\\\SAMBA\\RULEZ\\FOREVER\\");
 *     item3 = new csTreeItem (item2, "Home directory");
 *     item3 = new csTreeItem (item2, "Public stuff");
 *</code>

 *   <dt>Up/Down</dt><dd>Select previous/next tree item</dd>
