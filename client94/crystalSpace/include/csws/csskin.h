/**
 * This class defines the interface for a container of skins.
 * Most of the functionality you will want is already here; the
 * only method that you will sometimes want to override is the
 * constructor and the Initialize() method. In constructor you
 * should assign the appropiate value to the "Prefix" member
 * variable which is used to find the sections that refer
 * to the respective theme. Initialize() used to query all
 * kinds of resources from the application object when a
 * skin is initialized.
 *<p>
 * Generally there should be only one object of this class,
 * which is stored into the csApp object. However, you can use
 * a skin for some component and all his children if you wish,
 * but you will have to store the respective skin container
 * somewhere inside that component (and override his GetSkin()
 * method so that child components can use the skin when initialized).
 *<p>
 * The repository contains a number of objects that are responsible
 * for the exterior of the respective components (and which are called
 * `skins'). These objects are identified by a text string. After you change
 * the skin repository, you should call the Apply() method of the repository
 * so that the given objects and all components which are inserted into that
 * component (note that this does NOT have to do anything with class
 * hierarchy!) will receive the cscmdSkinChanged broadcast.

/**
 * A `skin slice' is responsible for managing the external view of a
 * certain component. Every `skin slice' is designed to take care of
 * some specific component type; you should be careful to provide all
 * `slices' for all used types of components, otherwise the windowing
 * system will print a error message and abort the program. Every
 * csComponent has a pointer to a csSkinSlice object inside, which
 * points to the respective object responsible for his exterior.
 *<p>
 * This is an abstract class, meant to be uses as a common parent
 * for all derived classes. Since some derived objects will implement
 * additional functionality over the basic csSkinSlice functionality,
 * it is recommended to #define a SKIN macro at the top of every
 * file with the implementation of the respective component like this:
 *<p>
 * #define SKIN ((csDefaultButtonSkin *)skinslice)
 *<p>
 * Then you can use the SKIN macro as if it was a member variable.
 * Note that the safety of the typecast is guaranteed by the uniquity
 * of the string returned by the csSkinSlice::GetName() method.
 *<p>
 * Also note that most skin slices don't have a constructor. This is
 * because skin slices are usually created before the application, thus
 * you don't have any place to gather initialization information from.
 * If you need to query some data from the application (e.g. some textures
 * and so on) you will have to overload the Initialize() virtual method.
