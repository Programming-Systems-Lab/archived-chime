/**
 * Graphics System pipeline class
 *<p>
 * This class implements all actual drawing operations (which are then
 * passed to iGraphics2D/iGraphics3D objects). The rectangle which
 * encapsulates all changes made to the screen is tracked. Upon frame
 * completion, this rectangle is kept in a memory buffer and then
 * propagated to all other videopages, thus for optimal performance
 * you should switch to single-buffered mode, if possible.
 *<p>
 * At the end of each frame, application object calls FinishFrame() method.
 * It will remember the dirty rectangle for current frame and call
 * iGraphics3D::Print() method to update the screen.
 *<p>
 * Since all drawing is made in real-time, the pipeline should call
 * BeginDraw with appropiate flags when needed. The graphics pipeline
 * tracks whenever the BeginDraw() with appropiate flags has been already
 * called, and doesn't do that again if it was done already. But if you
 * are doing interleaved drawing of 2D/3D primitives BeginDraw/FinishDraw
 * will be often called, thus reducing performance. That's why you should
 * try to group all 3D primitives together (like polygons) and draw all
 * them in one shot.
 *<p>
 * All methods and variables of this class are private. Only csApp should
 * have access to its internals, all graphics pipeline management is done
 * through main application object.
