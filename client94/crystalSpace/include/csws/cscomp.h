 * Component state flags.<p>

 * which can change in time depending on the activity of the component
 * (and user actions). These 32 bits are split into several conventional
 * fields, every set of bits being reserved for different tasks:
 * <pre>
 *  31    24 23    16 15     8 7      0
 * +--------+--------+--------+--------+
 * |        |        |        |        |
 * +--------+--------+--------+--------+
 * \---+---/ \---+--/ \-------+-------/
 *     |         |            +--------* Reserved for the csComponent class
 *     |         |                       (masks for these bits are defined below)
 *     |         +---------------------* Reserved for internal use by CSWS
 *     |                                 components, derived from csComponent.
 *     +-------------------------------* Reserved for user-defined components.
 * </pre>
 * Thus, all values matching the mask 0x0000ffff are reserved for csComponent,
 * all values matching the mask 0x00ff0000 are reserved for other CSWS
 * components (see csListBoxItem, for example), and finally all the
 * bits matching the mask 0xff000000 are reserved for user.
 * Pretty generous, eh? ;-)
