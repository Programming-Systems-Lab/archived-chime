 *
 * Usually one designs dialogs, forms etc. by placing components like
 * listcontrols, inputlines, treecontrols and so on at absolute locations
 * inside the dialog. While this is fine for a fixed size of your dialog
 * it turns out to be pretty ugly if you want allow resizing of dialogs,
 * forms etc. A comparable ugly effect you achive by running an application
 * in different window sizes.
 *
 * Layouts will help you to overcome this drawback.
 * They will allow you to relatively place a control and to resize
 * components when necessary.
 *
 * Layouts are themselfs csComponents and have a transparent canvas.
 * Thus you will not note them. One important issue about layouts is
 * that they will transfer all Events of type csevCommand to its parent
 * control. This will allow you overwrite just one HandleEvent to receive
 * all commands from the components embedded in the layouts no matter how
 * deeply nested they are.
