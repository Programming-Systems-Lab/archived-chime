/**
 * csGridBagLayout is the most flexible layout class.
 * Here is how it works:
 *
 * A grid is laid over the layout components canvas. This yields
 * rows and columns (oh, really ?) which cross in cells. Each cell is
 * able to hold a single component (which again can be layout components).
 * You are able to define whether a cell should span one or more columns and
 * same with rows. Furthermore you can define how additional space is
 * distributed among columns/rows if the layout is resized and becomes larger
 * or smaller.
 * A component in a cell is not set to fit a priori. You must tell if it
 * should be resized to cover the cell canvas. If you choose to not resize the
 * component in a cell you can set a relative position within the cell like:
 * CENTER ... center the component in the middle of the cell
 * NORTH  ... center the component horizontally and put it at top of cell
 * For more variations see below.
 * To make sure there is space at left/right and/or top/bottom between cell
 * borders and the components edges use ipadx and ipady.
 *
 * The grids cells are filled from left to right and top to bottom in the
 * sequence components with the csGridBagLayout as parent are created.
 * The filling starts at cell (0,0). To mark the last cell in a row simply
 * set gridwidth to REMAINDER. The next component added is set in the next
 * rows first cell. You can temporary break the filling sequence by setting
 * gridx and/or gridy to a particular value. To continue the normal filling
 * process set gridx/gridy to RELATIVE.
 *
