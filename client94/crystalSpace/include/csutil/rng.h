/*
    This random number generator originally appeared in "Toward a Universal
    Random Number Generator" by George Marsaglia and Arif Zaman.
    Florida State University Report: FSU-SCRI-87-50 (1987)

    It was later modified by F. James and published in "A Review of Pseudo-
    random Number Generators"

    THIS IS THE BEST KNOWN RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR AVAILABLE.
        (However, a newly discovered technique can yield
          a period of 10^600. But that is still in the development stage.)

    It passes ALL of the tests for random number generators and has a period
    of 2^144, is completely portable (gives bit identical results on all
    machines with at least 24-bit mantissas in the floating point
    representation).

    The algorithm is a combination of a Fibonacci sequence (with lags of 97
    and 33, and operation "subtraction plus one, modulo one") and an
    "arithmetic sequence" (using subtraction).

 * Portable random number generator class.<p>
 * The reason for using this class if that you may want a
 * consistent random number generator across all platforms
 * supported by Crystal Space. Besides, in general it is a
 * better quality RNG than the one supplied in most C runtime
 * libraries. Personally I observed a significant improvement
 * in a random terrain generator I made after I switched to
 * this RNG.
