   * The 'poly' parameter is expected to be a valid polygon. The Sprite...
   * lists should contain the (so far known) mapping of new indices to old
   * indices. In other words, these lists are adressed with the 'single index'
   * from the 3d sprite and return the 'multiple indices' used in the model
   * data components. In the process of converting several polygons with this
   * function, you should pass the same lists again and again. The lists will
   * (probably) be empty for the first polygon and be filled a bit more for
   * each polygon. Finally, after converting all polygons, the lists can be
   * used to convert the vertex frames. Finally, the 'PolyVertices' parameter
   * should be an empty list that will be filled with the 'single indices'. <p>
   *
   * You can omit those lists you do not need. For example, if you don't care
   * about vertex colors, pass NULL for 'SpriteColors'. This has the effect that
   * (obviously) you don't get a list of mapped vertex colors. It also tells
   * this function that vertices with different colors may be merged.
