 *  A mesh specially meant for use by the haze.
 *  This mesh must be a convex hull.
 *  for example: cubes, boxes, spheres, cones, cylinders, pyramids.
 *  A convex hull object can be defined as follows:
 *    from any point inside the object, all of the polygons are completely
 *    visible (none are obscured by other polygons from the convex hull).
 *  The ordering of the vertices (vertice numbering) is important when
 *  multiple hulls are used.
 *  Also edges must be numbered, with a number for each undirected edge.
 *  (i.e. a->b and b->a have the same edge number).
 *  Polygons thus have N vertices and N edges.
 *  For a particular polygon, the edges return their points in clockwise
 *  ordering.
