/**
 * This is an attempt to provide a  massdetection of backfaced polygons.
 *
 * Observation:
 * Mark 3 distinct points on a sphere. Consider the spherical triangle they form . If all
 * 3 points z-coordinates sign equal then all other points z-coordinate inside the
 * triangle have the same sign.
 *
 * It works this way:
 * Precompute the normals of a rigid set of polygons. These normals are unit size and
 * therefor mark a point on the unit sphere. If one rotates the polygonset all points
 * on the unit sphere are rotated by the same amount.
 *
 * To start off, subdivide the sphere into 8 spherical triangles. For every triangle make
 * a list of  points (normals) in it. For every triangle then subdivide further into 3
 * subtriangles and mark the points contained in it. Repeat this process until every
 * triangle contains only one point (normal).
 *
 * Now to find the backfaced polygons rotate the triangle points on level 0.
 * If a triangles points have all equally signed z-coordinates all polygons belonging
 * to it are either all visible or invisible.
 * If the signs differ then recursively test the subtriangles.
