// Implementation Note: Eric Sunshine <sunshine@sunshineco.com>      1999/02/09
//
// Certain portions of the Crystal Space code have strict requirements about
// the sizes of the structures csRGBcolor and csRGBpixel.  In particular, some
// pieces of code make these assumptions:
//
//    sizeof(csRGBcolor) == 3  (byte:rgb)
//    sizeof(csRGBpixel) == 4  (byte:rgb + byte:alpha)
//
// Originally, csRGBpixel was implemented as a subclasse of csRGBcolor and
// added a byte-sized "alpha" variable.  Thus, the original implementation made
// the assumption that the compiler would not pad out the csRGBcolor structure.
//
// Unfortunately in some environments (such as the NextStep compiler on M68K
// hardware) the compiler does pad csRGBcolor thus breaking the original
// assumptions about structure sizes.  In such cases, csRGBcolor is padded out
// to 4 bytes instead of 3 and csRGBpixel is padded out to 6 bytes instead of
// 4.  This padding results in problems in code which makes assumptions about
// the sizes of each structure.  In practice, problems were observed in code
// which expected csRGBpixel to be 4 bytes.
//
// To work around this problem, csRGBpixel has been re-implemented so that it
// is no longer derived from csRGBcolor.  An unfortunate side-effect of this
// re-implementation is that code is no longer inherited, and is thus
// duplicated in each class.  However, except for this minor point, the size of
// each structure should now be more stable between various compilers.
