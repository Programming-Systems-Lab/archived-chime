/**
 * The sound handle is a sound in the state that is needed by the sound
 * renderer. It can be used to create instances of the sound, the sound
 * sources (the Play() method is only a convenience method to create and
 * play a sound source). <p>
 *
 * Sounds can be either static or streamed, depending on the sound data the
 * handle is created from. There is a basic difference between these two modes
 * how they are used: You can create any number of totally independent sound
 * sources from a static sound, but not from a streamed sound. All sources
 * that are created from the same streamed sound *always* play the same
 * sequence of samples, if they play sound at all. So the Play() and Stop()
 * methods of a streamed sound source only set the source to active or
 * quiet mode, but they don't control the position that is currently played.
 * Instead this position is controlled with the sound handle interface.
