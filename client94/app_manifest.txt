 Application Manifest
 ====================

   blocks - A falling blocks game (think 3D Teris).

   cctest - A test application for the Crystal Clear library and plug-in module.

  csfedit - A simple GUI based font editor for Crystal Space.

    csvid - A test application for the OpenDivX video plugin. To run this application
            you will need to download and install the OpenDivX codec for Windows, which
            can be obtained from: http://www.projectmayo.com

 cswstest - This application tests the Crystal Space Windowing System (CSWS),
            which is designed to provide a clean, effective and cross-platform
            base for creating CrystalSpace-related utilites.

  demosky - An application demonstrating the sky procedural texture.

    dnapp - A test application for the dungeon plug-in module, the random level
            generator. It allows to set the output options for the plug-in via
            command-line parameters.

  g2dtest - The Crystal Space canvas plugin test application.

  gfxtest - The Crystal Space image manipulator.

  levtool - A level maintenance tool (work in progress!). 

    mazed - This application is the Crystal Space map editor. It is a work
            currently in progress.

 metademo - A demostration application which draws texture-mapped meta-balls
            in a free-form, dynamic blob.

 perftest - This is a tool to test graphics performance.

 phyztest - This application tests the physics library for proper operation.

    ptlab - A test application for procedural textures.

   scfreg - This application is used to register plug-in modules, such as the
            software and hardware renderers, with Crystal Space's SCF mechanism.

   simple - Developers should use this application as a guide when devloping their
            new programs. Its code tends to be much cleaner than that of `walktest',
            and makes proper use of various modules in the engine

 walktest - The quintessential Crystal Space test program. `walktest' is the test
            harness for most of the features which get added to the engine.
