Number of clients here for a given video session
This information will eventually be fed into the
AI2TV system via some sort of workgroup calendar
which is currently a work in progress. The syntax
for this file is fairly simple, and it's simplicity
is what allows for unlimited unmarked commenting
at the bottom.  Basically, it is of the following
format:

[N] // The number of clients in the list
{[ClientID] [ClientIPAddr]}+
[URL OF DIRECTORY HOLDING JPEGS]
[FILENAME of Frame List, relative to above URL]


The second line is repeated N times, and beyond that
the downloaded file is not read. Hence, the comments.

So, basically, prepare yourself for a scanf which will
read the first line with a "%d" and each successive 
line as "%d %s" and then a "%s" for the base URL, and a
"%s" for the filename of the frame index.
