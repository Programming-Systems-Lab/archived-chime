This Siena API can be compiled on win32 platforms with Visual C++.  

To compile, rename (or copy):

     Makefil-win32 to Makefile
     and 
     sienaconf-win32.h to sienaconf.h

then use Microsoft nmake to compile.  You can also compile in a
seprate directory, which is what I normally do.  Just do:

     cd <where_you_want_to_compile>
     nmake -f <where_the_sources_are>\Makefile srcdir=<where_the_sources_are>

WARNING: I have done only *minimal* testing on the Visual C++ port.
